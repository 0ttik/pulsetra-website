  <!-- Privacy Policy -->
  <main class="legal">
    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="legal__updated">Last updated: February 19, 2025</p>

    <p>ITCasters ("we", "us", or "our") operates the <strong>Pulsetra — Heart Rate</strong> mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Health &amp; Measurement Data</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Heart rate (BPM)</strong> — measured via your device's rear camera and flash using photoplethysmography.</li>
      <li><strong>Blood pressure</strong> — systolic and diastolic values entered manually by you.</li>
      <li><strong>Timestamps</strong> — date and time of each measurement.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All health and measurement data is stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>. We do not upload, transmit, or store your health data on any external server.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Camera Access</h3>
    <p>The App requires access to your device's rear camera and flash solely to detect your pulse through your fingertip. <strong>No images or video are captured, stored, or transmitted.</strong> Camera data is processed in real time and immediately discarded after each measurement.</p>

    <h3>1.3 Apple Health Data</h3>
    <p>If you grant permission, the App reads and writes heart rate and blood pressure data to Apple Health. This data is managed by Apple under Apple's own privacy policies and stays on your device (or your iCloud account if you have Health syncing enabled). We do not have access to your Apple Health data outside of the App.</p>

    <h3>1.4 Push Notification Token</h3>
    <p>If you enable daily measurement reminders, we receive a device token from Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) to deliver local notifications. This token is stored only on your device and is not sent to any external server.</p>

    <h3>1.5 Subscription &amp; Purchase Data</h3>
    <p>We use <strong>Apphud</strong> to manage in-app subscriptions. When you make a purchase, Apphud processes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An anonymous user identifier (generated by Apphud)</li>
      <li>Purchase transaction details (product ID, receipt, price)</li>
      <li>Device information (OS version, app version)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No personal information such as your name, email address, or Apple ID is collected by Apphud unless you voluntarily provide it. See <a href="https://apphud.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apphud's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h3>1.6 Analytics &amp; Attribution</h3>
    <p>We use the following third-party services to understand how the App is used and improve the experience:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> — collects anonymous usage events (e.g., screen views, feature usage), device type, and OS version. No personally identifiable information is collected. See <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebase Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>AppsFlyer</strong> — collects install attribution data including device advertising identifier (IDFA, only with your consent via App Tracking Transparency), anonymous user ID, and install source. See <a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/legal/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AppsFlyer Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.7 Local Storage</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>ObjectBox database</strong> — stores your measurements and app settings locally on your device with iOS data protection encryption.</li>
      <li><strong>iOS Keychain</strong> — stores sensitive settings securely using the device's built-in encryption.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide core functionality: measure heart rate, log blood pressure, display statistics and history.</li>
      <li>Sync measurements with Apple Health when you grant permission.</li>
      <li>Deliver push notification reminders when you enable them.</li>
      <li>Process and manage your subscription through Apphud.</li>
      <li>Analyze anonymous usage patterns to improve the App.</li>
      <li>Attribute app installs to marketing sources (with your consent).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We <strong>do not sell</strong> your personal data or health data to any third party.</p>
    <p>We share limited data only with the following service providers, solely for the purposes described above:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Apphud</strong> — subscription management (anonymous identifiers and purchase receipts).</li>
      <li><strong>AppsFlyer</strong> — install attribution (anonymous device data; IDFA only with your ATT consent).</li>
      <li><strong>Firebase (Google)</strong> — anonymous usage analytics.</li>
      <li><strong>Apple</strong> — Health data (only if you enable Apple Health integration), push notification delivery via APNS.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local measurements:</strong> Stored on your device until you delete them within the App or uninstall the App.</li>
      <li><strong>Apple Health data:</strong> Managed by Apple per your Apple Health settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Apphud data:</strong> Retained per <a href="https://apphud.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apphud's data retention policy</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics data:</strong> Retained per Firebase and AppsFlyer policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access:</strong> View all your measurements and data within the App (Statistics and Settings screens).</li>
      <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Delete individual measurements within the App, or uninstall the App to remove all locally stored data. Manage Apple Health data separately through the Health app.</li>
      <li><strong>Opt out of notifications:</strong> Disable reminders in the App settings or in your device's notification settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Opt out of tracking:</strong> Deny the App Tracking Transparency prompt to prevent IDFA-based attribution.</li>
      <li><strong>Data portability:</strong> Your data is available in Apple Health if syncing is enabled.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For data requests or concerns, contact us at <a href="mailto:info@itcasters.kz">info@itcasters.kz</a>.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All health data is stored locally on your device with iOS data protection (hardware-level encryption).</li>
      <li>Sensitive settings are stored in iOS Keychain.</li>
      <li>Network communications with third-party services use HTTPS encryption.</li>
      <li>No health data is transmitted to our servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@itcasters.kz">info@itcasters.kz</a> so we can take appropriate action.</p>

    <h2>8. International Users</h2>
    <p>The App is available worldwide. By using the App, you consent to the processing of your information as described in this policy. Third-party services (Apphud, Firebase, AppsFlyer) may process data in countries outside your jurisdiction.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
